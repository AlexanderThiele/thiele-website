title: "The MVP is done. What now? | LinkFive"

The development of LinkFive is finished for now. And now? The big
question of questions has come!

What do we do now? How do we get users? Is the first MVP even ready for
use?

Many startups are online as soon as possible so that the software can be
tested by the first users.

This is exactly where
[LinkFive](https://www.linkfive.io?ref=thiele-blog) is right now.

And right now I ask myself many questions: Can the MVP be used at all?
We test, of course, as much as possible during development, but we never
know how the user will use it. What if the MVP doesn't work the way it
was built? What if only small detail is missing for the MVP to work? And
how do I even find out? Have I perhaps missed the problem?

Phew...

In the end, you just have to talk to the customer directly. But it's
anything but easy to get in touch with the user, especially if it's a
B2B product. A startup doesn't have a lot of money to spend on user
testing. One is rather dependent on the inexpensive.

## Try \#1 the own network

Let's take a look at our own network:
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/athiele/).

On the journey of a software developer, you meet one or the other person
and stay in contact mostly on LinkedIn.

So I went through the contact list... Damn, there is no one there who
fits into my target group. That would have been too perfect.

So I have no choice but to try something else. What do I actually need?
And how is this going to work?

Here are some notes:

- It has to be scalable somehow.
- I need to be able to contact the user somehow.
- I need to know where the user is coming from and how they became aware
  of [LinkFive](https://www.linkfive.io?ref=thiele-blog).

But that‘s it until the next post.
