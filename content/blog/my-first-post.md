# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my very first blog post. I've built this site using the [Jaspr](https://jaspr.site) framework for Dart, which allows me to write components in Dart and render them both on the server and client.

## Why Jaspr?

Jaspr is fantastic because:
- **Fast:** It has great performance out of the box.
- **Dart:** I can use the same language for the whole stack.
- **Flexible:** I can easily mix static Markdown content with interactive components.
