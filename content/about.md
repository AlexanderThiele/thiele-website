## Where do you live?

I live in **Munich, Germany** and previously spent several years in Berlin working in various startups and even founded my own startup.

## Where have you worked as a technology leader?

When I was still a Senior Android Engineer at Doodle, I got the chance to make my first experiences as an engineering manager in 2017. In the beginning, the Berlin team started with 4 employees and grew to over 30 after a few years. I created a friendly company & engineering culture and was also a prokurist for Doodle Germany and managed legal, contracts, accounting, and payroll for the entire team in Germany.

In 2019, I joined a startup as the CTO (Chief Technology Officer) in Berlin. Prosperity was a FinTech & Digital Insurance Startup (Private Pension Management). I established an entirely new engineering team, created the technical roadmap and cleared all roadblocks. We were re-thinking the digital insurances with a scalable Backend, a shiny Frontend & stable Native Apps. The backend service managed around 400 million CHF in assets in the countries Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria, France, and Italy. Growing the team from 2 to 13. I was also a Managing Director and managed legal, contracts, accounting, and payroll in close cooperation with the team in Liechtenstein.

## You also founded a startup, right?

Yes, in 2020 i founded LinkFive, moved to Munich and built the whole tech B2B SaaS myself. LinkFive is the Flutter In-App- Purchase Management service with a self developed Flutter plugin. Scaling multiple backends on gcloud cloud run with kotlin ktor, service communication with PubSub, API frontend with Vue.js, Flutter Plugins / Android SDK for Apps and landing page and developer documentation with gatsby.

I have learned a lot and I am glad that I have taken the step to found a company.

## Why do you like Flutter?

Throughout my career I've used and tested quite a few frameworks. I started with native development and tested phonegap, react native and Flutter right after it was released.

With Flutter, the developer experience was by far the best. The development was just extremely fun and the community is just great. There are really a lot of plugins that developers put up for free on github and pub.dev.
