# Mapping `jaspr_content` to `jaspr` in Context7

## Description
When searching for `jaspr_content` documentation in Context7, it should be accessed via the `/schultek/jaspr` library ID, as it is bundled with the main framework.

## Context/Reasoning
I attempted to resolve `jaspr_content` as a separate library ID, which failed. Subsequent investigation and successful retrieval confirmed that `jaspr_content` documentation is integrated within the `jaspr` repository documentation.

## Actionable Item
Always use the library ID `/schultek/jaspr` (resolved from `jaspr`) to query documentation for `jaspr_content`, `jaspr_router`, and other Jaspr-related sub-packages.
