# Recreated About Page

## Type
Decision

## Date
2026-02-17

## Description
Recreated `content/about.md` to focus strictly on a list of events, talks, and videos, removing the personal biography and email address.

## Context/Reasoning
The user requested a cleaner, more achievement-focused "About" page. Research was conducted to identify specific talks and events Alexander Thiele participated in, including his role as a Google Developer Expert (GDE) and various international conference presentations.

## Actionable Item
- Maintain the list format for the "About" page.
- Do not add personal narrative text to this page unless explicitly requested.
