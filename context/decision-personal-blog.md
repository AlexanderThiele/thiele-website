# Switch to Personal Blog

## Type

## Description
The project was repurposed from a generic documentation site to a personal blog for Alexander Thiele.

## Context/Reasoning
The user explicitly requested to turn this website into their personal blog to share articles written in Markdown. This aligns with the capabilities of `jaspr_content` but required a structural shift in navigation and page layout.

## Actionable Item
- Treat `content/blog/` as the primary source of new content.
- Maintain the "Blog" sidebar group in `DocsLayout`.
- Ensure all future design choices reflect a "personal brand" aesthetic rather than a generic doc site.
